## Inspiration and that stuff

I wanted to create an island project for some time since i started doing the [course made by Bruno Simon](https://threejs-journey.com)

And the opportunity arrived when Bruno posted the 17th challenge, the "Island" challenge, now, i got sick the first week and had to deal with college also, so i know there are a lot of things that could have gone better, but i wanted to give it a shot anyway.

I knew my main inspiration came from the PS1 graphics, there's something about those old games i used to play when i was a child, graphics of Crash Bandicoot and Fighting Force (and also Silent Hill 1 that scared the hell out of me when i was a child so i didn't really dared to play it at that moment) always had a special taste that i couldn't find anywhere else. I wanted to give the island that sort of abandoned low-poly look, mixed with the dithering effect provided by old CRT screens like the one i used to have.

Seeing those games now they look bland and poorly made, but that's because modern rendering techniques allows us to see every single detail, back when screens had more defficiencies to portray accurately pixel ratios, pixel sizes, etc. (mostly because of the scanning method they used) a lot was left to the imagination. And i loved it.

Now, i won't say that this project has gotten onto that point, there's a lot missing, i would love to expand more on this idea, but it will have to be another time.

For now i tried to mix the low poly style of Fighting Force, i wanted that blocky feeling, with some tropical setting like the ones Crash Bandicoot reminds me of, and to add some Silent Hill into the mix, adding the pickup mechanics from the game
